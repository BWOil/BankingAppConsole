### ðŸ“¦ Design Patterns

1.DTO - models
Summary: (rewrite)

DTO (Data Transfer Object) is a pattern used to transfer data between parts of a software application. It encapsulates data into a single object, reducing the number of calls and simplifying data transfer, especially in network environments. DTOs are simple, serializable objects used mainly for data transport without business logic.
